This repo contains the code used to generate figures for the triple
task 2022 SFN poster. The main analysis can be run by running the
first section of main.m. Subsequent plotting functions can be used to
generate the figures.

Also included is parameter_recover.m, which performs a parameter
recovery analysis for a fitted mixture model. Running can take a long
time (~30 mins) depending on the range of the parameter sweep.

The file vmrand.m was borrowed from the Circular Statistics Toolbox on
MATLAB File Exchange. The associated license for this file
(license.txt) is included.

Jingyan has also created a repository for analyzing this same data,
